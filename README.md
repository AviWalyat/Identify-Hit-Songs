## Identify-Hit-Songs

## Overview
We aim to offer music producers and composers valuable guidance and insights on crafting hit songs. This project involves the analysis of song lyrics across different decades to uncover emotional trends. By leveraging natural language processing techniques, this analysis explores the evolving emotional landscapes portrayed in songs.

## Data
The dataset used for this analysis comprises song lyrics spanning from the 1960s to the 2010s. Each decade's emotional content, including joy, trust, fear, anger, and anticipation, was quantified to identify trends and shifts in lyrical themes. We collected this data by scraping various online sources, including music databases and lyrics repositories. The scraping process involved extracting lyrics while adhering to website terms of service and copyright regulations.

## Preprocessing
The data underwent several preprocessing steps, including text cleaning, tokenization, and sentiment analysis. This involved removing irrelevant characters, stopwords, and formatting the data for further analysis.

## Emotional Analysis
Using NLP libraries, emotional content in the lyrics was quantified across key emotional dimensions: joy, trust, fear, anger, and anticipation. Each decade's emotional distribution was analyzed to identify prevalent emotional themes.

## Visualization
The emotional trends were visualized using charts and graphs to clearly represent how emotional content in song lyrics has shifted over different decades.

## Conclusion
This project offers insights into the changing emotional landscape reflected in song lyrics over time. The analysis provides a glimpse into societal and cultural shifts captured through the emotional content of music.

## Future Enhancements
Potential future enhancements include incorporating advanced sentiment analysis techniques, exploring regional or genre-based emotional trends, and building predictive models for emotional analysis.
